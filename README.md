# ForestFireAndWine
**Analysis 1: Regression**  

The UCI Machine Learning repository contains a variety of real-world datasets. For this example, we will analyse forest fire data, taken from here:  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires  
For each data point in the sample, the amount of burnt land is quantified by the variable area, which gives the hectares burnt. Further information on the dataset is available in the accompanying paper here:  
http://www.dsi.uminho.pt/~pcortez/fires.pdf  
Split the forest fire dataset into a training set (80% of the data) and a testing set (20% of the data). 
Then:
•	Build a regression model using k nearest neighbours that can predict the burnt area for new data points. To make the prediction, use a weighted average of the area values for the nearest neighbour points.  
•	For the same dataset, build a multiple linear regression model in Excel that can predict the area.  
  
**Analysis 2: Clustering**
  
In this example, I will analyse the wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository that is described here:  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine  
The actual csv file for the data is available here:  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data  
Then:  
•	Perform a k means clustering analysis for different values of k, including running the analysis multiple times with different initial centroid positions.  
•	By making a scree plot of the lowest cluster distortion found for each value of k vs k, determine the optimal number of clusters in the data.
